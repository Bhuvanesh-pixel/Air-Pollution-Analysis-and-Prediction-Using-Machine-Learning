# Air-Pollution-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The problem of air pollution is a significant global challenge with serious health, environmental and economic implications. Predicting air pollution using machine learning time series analysis with ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models is important because it offers a powerful tool to handle the complexity and dynamic nature of air pollution, leading to better-informed decisions that can protect public health and the environment.
In this project machine learning is used for time series analysis with ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models. These models are tailored to handle the inherent seasonal trends and nonstationarity in air pollution data. ARIMA models capture the autocorrelations in time series data, while seasonal ARIMA adds layers to address seasonal variations, critical in air pollution due to factors like changing weather and seasonal industrial activities. This approach allows for robust forecasting of pollution levels, essential for environmental management and policy planning.
